\# Loan Eligibility Prediction



A simple machine learning project that predicts whether a person is eligible for a loan based on demographic and financial data.



\## 🔍 Problem Statement



Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications daily. Manually assessing these is time-consuming and error-prone. This project uses a machine learning model to automate loan eligibility predictions, helping reduce manual workload and improve accuracy.



\## 📂 Files Included



| File Name                | Description |

|--------------------------|-------------|

| `Loan\_Data.csv`          | The dataset containing applicant information (gender, income, education, etc.) and loan approval status. |

| `Loan\_Prediction.ipynb`  | The Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and prediction logic. |

| `README.md`              | Project overview and documentation. |



\## 🧠 ML Approach



\- \*\*Data Cleaning\*\*: Handling missing values and categorical encoding

\- \*\*Feature Selection\*\*: Keeping relevant features for prediction

\- \*\*Model Used\*\*: Logistic Regression (can be swapped with Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)

\- \*\*Evaluation\*\*: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Cross-Validation



\## 📊 Technologies Used



\- Python

\- Jupyter Notebook

\- Pandas \& NumPy

\- Scikit-learn

\- Matplotlib \& Seaborn



\## 🚀 How to Run



1\. Clone the repo or download the files:

git clone https://github.com/zonaed25/loan-eligibility-prediction.git

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
Loan\_Prediction.ipynb

3. Run through the notebook cells to train and test the model



\## ✅ Future Improvements



\- Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

\- Add support for multiple model options

\- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask

\- Connect to a live input form
